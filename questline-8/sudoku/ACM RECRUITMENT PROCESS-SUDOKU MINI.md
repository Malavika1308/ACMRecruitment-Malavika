* Column 2 has 1 at row4 and row 2 contains 1 at column 4.
* So that means we can 1 can be only be placed in row1,column1.
* row2 already has 3 and 1 so that means 2 and 4 are left. lets just guess that row2,column1 is 2. that means row2,coulmn3 is 4.
* since r1,c1 being 1 and r2c1 being 2 and r3c1 being 3, r4c1 will be  equal to 4.
* since r2 has 2,3 and 1 filled 4 must go to r2,c3.
* column 3 has 3 and 4 at r1 and r2 positions respectively and r4,c2 already has 1 which means r3c3=1. Which give us the position r4c3=2.
* Now row 4 already has 4,1 and 2. So r4c4=3.
* Since the top left 2\*2 box need 4 to complete the chain r1c2=4. Which means r1c4=2.
* Coulmn 2 has 4,3 and 1 which means r3c2=2.
* Column 4 has 2,1 and 3 which means r3,c4=4.
