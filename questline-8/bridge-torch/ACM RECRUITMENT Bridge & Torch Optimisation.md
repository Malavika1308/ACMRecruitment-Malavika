# ***ACM RECRUITMENT Bridge \& Torch Optimization***







**From what I understood from reading the task, my point of view is that all the four people have to cross the bridge under 20 minutes.**

**If this is the case, then lets name the four people as p1,p2,p3 and p4.**



* First p1 and p2 cross the bridge with the torch.(Now the total time=2mins)
* Then p1 comes back with torch(total time=3mins)
* Now p3 and p4 cross the bride together.(total time=13mins)
* Then p2 returns back to the original place with the torch.(total time=15mins)
* Now p1 and p2 cross the bridge together(total time=17mins)
