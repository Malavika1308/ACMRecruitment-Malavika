<p><i>My name is Malavika A. I took CSE(AI). I like to play basketball, watch F1 and play valorant. In my free time I love to binge watch series.<br>I love learning new coding languages and building something by myself in the future. I also have an unhealthy obsession with one direction <br>since I was 9. Since I talked about F1, I would like to also mention the fact that I am a Lewis Fan:).<i></p>
